# TSP-problem-
Travelling salesman problem for pizza delivery service which is optimized with 2-opt , written in java and includes graphics to display the optimum route!
This application was made for my 2nd year , 2nd semester computer science project. We were given the following information 
1. Graphically we had to display an optimized route for a pizza delivery driver to take when given a list of addresses.
2. The optimized result was not based on the shortest distance travelled but the amount of angry minutes taken to deliver all of the pizzas. 
3. An angry minute is considered as any time over 30 mins taken to deliver a pizza to a customer e.g. 32 mins = 2 angry mins.
4. The driver travells at 60 KMPH.
5. The program has a time limit of 10 seconds to run.
